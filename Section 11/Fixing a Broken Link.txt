Fixing a Broken Link
There's a tiny error in the web page - one link is broken.

On the "Customers" page (=> index.html in the "customers" folder), there is a link which leads into the void. The "Start Hosting" link should point to "../start-hosting/index.html" .

We'll also fix it together in a later video but feel free doing that right now already.
