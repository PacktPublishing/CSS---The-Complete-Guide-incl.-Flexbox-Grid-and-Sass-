CSS "animation" Property Deep Dive
The animation  property is used as see in the previous video:

animation: NAME DURATION DELAY TIMING-FUNCTION ITERATION DIRECTION FILL-MODE PLAY-STATE; 

Example:

animation: wiggle 200ms 1s ease-out 8 alternate forwards running; 

Can be translated to: "Play the wiggle keyframe set (animation) over a duration of 200ms. Between two keyframes start fast and end slow, also make sure to wait 1s before you start. Play 8 animations and alternate after each animation. Once you're done, keep the final value applied to the element. Oh, and you should be playing the animation - not pausing."

Instead of this shorthand, you can also specify the individual properties:

1) animation-name  (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/animation-name => animation-name: wiggle; 

2) animation-duration  (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/animation-duration) => animation-duration: 200ms; 

3) animation-timing-function  (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/animation-timing-function) => animation-timing-function: ease-out; 

Possible timing function values are: ease-out , ease-in , linear , cubic-bezier()  and a couple of others. See the above link for more details.

4) animation-delay  (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/animation-delay) => animation-delay: 1s; 

5) animation-iteration-count  (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/animation-iteration-count) => animation-iteration-count: 8; 

6) animation-direction  (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/animation-direction) => animation-direction: alternate; 

7) animation-fill-mode  (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/animation-fill-mode) => animation-fill-mode: forwards; 

8) animation-play-state  (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/animation-play-state) => animation-play-state: running;
